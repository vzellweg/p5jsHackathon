# Victor Z's P5js Hackathon Project
This was an open-ended project with the goal of creating some interactive visualization using p5js.

## What went well

- Learned a good bit about drawing on a 2D canvas in p5js
- Dynamizally created and animated a grid of interactive polygons
- Added sound-reactivity

## What didn't go well

- Covid booster wrecked me >_<
- Spent a little too much time figuring out hwo I wanted to deploy the script
- Did not have time to make a script that used a 3D, WEBGL canvas
- Did not have time to explore sound synthesis or playback

# What would I do next?

- Complex WaveForms for modulation, using those same waveforms to modulate sound
- Know how I want to deploy my work ahead of time so I can spend most of my hackathon time focusing on the new technology 
- 3D stuff
- Make a visualization of some abstract concept (Math or Comp Sci)

## Local Development
Run `yarn install` to install dependencies. 

Run `yarn serve` to start the server.
